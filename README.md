# Polynomial-Solver
A linked allocation system to represent and manipulate polynomials using the implemented linked list.

The application performs the following operations:
* Read in a polynomial and store it in variable A, B, or C.
* Output a polynomial using a form that clearly displays it.
* Add two polynomials and store the result in R.
* Subtract two polynomials and store the result in R.
* Multiply two polynomials and store the result in R.
* Evaluate a polynomial at some point, a, where a is a floating point constant. In other words, substitute by the given value in your polynomial. Display the result as a floating point.
* Clear a polynomial. Note that: a polynomial whose value is cleared or initially unset cannot be involved in an operation.
* The core of the application throws a runtime exception when it encounter any invalid input or operation.
